# A.Here are the Terraform configurations to create the VPC and Networking components.
## 1.VPC Module

The vpc.tf will define the VPC, including public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones.which included with variables.tf we have configured.

## 2. Internet Gateway

internet_gateway.tf – Create Internet Gateway and associate it with the VPC

## 3. NAT Gateway

nat_gateway.tf – Create NAT Gateways for private subnets to access the internet

## 4. Route Tables
route_tables.tf – Define Route Tables for public and private subnets

## 5. Security Groups

security_groups.tf – Define Security Groups

## 6. Route 53 Integration
route_53.tf – Set up Route 53 for DNS Management
###  Variables (route53_variables.tf) for Route 53


# B.Here are the Terraform configurations for defining IAM roles for EKS and S3 access, as well as enabling KMS for encryption of data at rest in S3 and EBS.

## 1. IAM Roles for EKS and S3
The IAM roles will provide necessary permissions for the EKS cluster and pods to access AWS services like S3.
iam_roles.tf – Define IAM Roles for EKS and S3

## Variables for IAM Roles (iam_variables.tf)

# 2. KMS Configuration
The KMS (Key Management Service) setup will provide encryption for data at rest in S3 and EBS volumes.
## kms.tf – Define KMS for S3 and EBS Encryption
Usage of KMS Key for EBS and S3 Encryption
In our EBS volume or S3 configuration, mentioned in that .tf file for reference.

# c. EKS Cluster Configuration
We'll use the official AWS EKS Terraform module to provision the EKS cluster. The cluster will be deployed across multiple AZs for high availability.

eks.tf – Define the EKS Cluster with Multi-AZ Deployment

2. EKS Node Group Configuration
Here, we define the managed node group across multiple AZs with EC2-based nodes.

eks_node_group.tf – EC2 Managed Node Groups Across AZs

3. Cluster Autoscaler
Cluster Autoscaler will ensure the EKS cluster scales based on resource demand. You'll need to deploy the Cluster Autoscaler as a Helm chart within the EKS cluster and attach necessary permissions using IAM.

autoscaler.tf – Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler Configuration

#### Variables for EKS (eks_variables.tf)
Summary of Files:
eks.tf: Provisions the EKS cluster using the official EKS Terraform module.
eks_node_group.tf: Defines EC2-based managed node groups for the EKS cluster.
autoscaler.tf: Configures Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler for autoscaling based on load, with the appropriate IAM policies.
These configurations set up an EKS cluster that scales across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring high availability and efficient resource management.

# Here is an example of how you can define Terraform configurations for EBS volumes and S3 buckets with IAM roles and policies to restrict access from EKS pods:

1. ebs.tf: Creating EBS Volumes
In this configuration, we are creating EBS volumes to persist data for PostgreSQL and Redis.
2. s3_buckets.tf: Creating S3 Buckets for Object Storage
Here’s how to define an S3 bucket for application data, with versioning and lifecycle rules.
